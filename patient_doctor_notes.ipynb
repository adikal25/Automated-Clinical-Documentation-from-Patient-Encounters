The patient mentions that their family members have also been ill with chest congestion and frequent coughing. The patient expresses concern regarding whether they should simply stay comfortable and endure the sensations or seek medical evaluation.\n",
            "- Relevant Past Medical History: The patient reports having had two heart stents placed within the past 11 months. The patient noted that they have not experienced asthma attacks for a few years until now.\n",

            "- Follow-up with a primary care provider and/or cardiologist and pulmonologist as necessary.\n",
